# Stock Insights and Forecasting using ML

This project leverages various technologies to process, analyze, and visualize stock market data. The workflow includes streaming data from AWS S3 using Apache Kafka, processing it in Python, storing it in MySQL, and visualizing the results using Power BI. A Flask application serves as the frontend interface for interacting with the system.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on real-time data streaming, predictive analysis, and visualization of stock market trends using machine learning models.

## Technologies Used

1. **AWS**
   - **Role:** Data storage and simulation environment.
   - **Details:** Stock market data is stored in AWS services and used for simulation and data ingestion.

2. **Apache Kafka**
   - **Role:** Data streaming and message brokering.
   - **Details:** Kafka streams data from AWS to a processing pipeline, ensuring real-time data handling.

3. **Python**
   - **Role:** Data processing and predictive analysis.
   - **Details:**
     - **Data Frame:** Data is loaded into a Python DataFrame for analysis.
     - **Predictive Models:** Linear Regression, AdaBoost Regression, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are applied to forecast stock trends.

4. **MySQL**
   - **Role:** Data storage for reporting.
   - **Details:** Kafka connectors append processed data to a MySQL database, which is then used for generating reports.

5. **Power BI**
   - **Role:** Reporting and data visualization.
   - **Details:** Reports and dashboards are created using Power BI to visualize stock trends and analytics.

6. **Flask**
   - **Role:** Frontend interface.
   - **Details:** A Flask application provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the system, visualizing data, and accessing analysis results.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Apache Kafka
- Confluent Kafka Python Client
- Pandas
- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- MySQL
- Power BI
- Flask

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-insights-forecasting-ml.git
   cd stock-insights-forecasting-ml
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install confluent-kafka pandas boto3 flask mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Set up Kafka:**
   - Ensure you have Apache Kafka installed and running.
   - Configure Kafka to produce data from your AWS S3 bucket.

4. **Set up AWS S3:**
   - Ensure your stock market data is stored in an S3 bucket.
   - Update your Kafka producer to stream data from S3.

5. **Set up MySQL:**
   - Install and configure MySQL.
   - Ensure your Kafka connectors are correctly configured to append data to your MySQL database.

6. **Set up Power BI:**
   - Connect Power BI to your MySQL database to create reports and dashboards.

7. **Set up Flask:**
   - Configure the Flask application to serve the web interface for data visualization and analysis.

## Usage

### Kafka Producer

To stream data from AWS S3 using Kafka:

```bash
# Command or script to run the Kafka producer
```

### Kafka Consumer

To consume the streamed data in Python:

```bash
python consume_data.py
```

### Flask Application

To start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Power BI

Use Power BI to create and view reports based on the data stored in MySQL.
